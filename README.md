Currently in order to build this project you must be on windows and use vcpkg.

Make sure manifest mode is enabled: 
project --> properties --> vcpkg --> check manifest mode

All of the libraries I have used so far *claim* to be cross platform so a linux/mac version should be possible if everything does not work under Wine.
